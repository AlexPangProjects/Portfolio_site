                        I'm also an electrical/electronic engineering student and have experience with a variety of technologies.
                        <br>I am proficient in C/C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL.
                        <br>I also have experience working with LLMs, especially with creating and evaluating training data.

                        This website serves as a portfolio and testbed for creating a responsive static website.
                        <br> This site only uses HTML and CSS to ensure speed and simplicity.
                        <br> It is barebones for readability and avoids using animations that may impact this.
                        <br> Please check out my projects if you want to see my usage of Javascript and React.

                        For hobbies, I'm interested in hiking, bouldering, cars and motorbikes.
                        <br>I particularly like JDM cars and own an EK Civic hatchback.
                        <br>You can find a gallery I made of my hiking and other hobby related images <a>here</a>.
